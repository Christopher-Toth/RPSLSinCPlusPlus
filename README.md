# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game in x86 Assembly

This is a simple console-based implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game in C++. The game allows you to play against the computer and keeps track of your score.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to compile and run the game on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can use popular compilers like g++ (GNU Compiler Collection) or Microsoft Visual C++.

### Assembly and Execution

1. Clone the repository or download the `rpsls.cpp` file.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `rpsls.cpp` file is located.

3. Compile the code using your C++ compiler. For example, using g++:

  bash g++ rpsls.cpp -o rpsls

4. Run the game:

   ./rpsls

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. You can choose Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock, or Quit.

6. When you're done playing, the game will display your final score and exit.

## Gameplay

* The game displays your score and asks you to choose an option (0-Rock, 1-Paper, 2-Scissors, 3-Lizard, 4-Spock, 5-Quit).

* The computer randomly selects its choice.

* The game compares your choice to the computer's choice and displays the result (Win, Lose, or Tie).

* Your score is updated based on the result.

* You can choose to quit the game at any time.
